A collection of interesting quotes. Note that some of them are not quoted
word-by-word, but hopefully I still manage to capture the gist in those ones.

- There are no guarantees in love, war, and reinforcement learning. -- Dimitri
    Bertsekas in the Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning online course

- [Being a good investor in the stock market] is about betting against the
    consensus and be right, because the consensus is built into the price. --
    Ray Dalio in a TED talk

- For many proofs, there are often underlying images that capture the
    intuition. The algebra just formulates the images. -- Ben Van Roy in MS\&E
