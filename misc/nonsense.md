excerpt: "Nonsense"
---

A collection of nonsense. Read only when you are extremely bored and have
nothing to do.

- In Chinese, some of us use the expression "to think with one's butt/toes/..."
    to mean that one is not thinking straight, in which case one should be
    thinking with one's brain. One day, it occured to me that people do have
    nerves in their butts and toes, too. Does it mean that people can actually
    think with their toes? Then, I did some google search and quickly found out
    that nerves and neurons are different things, and nerves only exist to
    transmit the information. So, sadly, our butts and toes are indeed dumb.
