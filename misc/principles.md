# Principles
A description of what these are can be found
[here]({% post_url 2019-5-6-Principles%}).

## Life
- When a decision is not important, do not waste too much time thinking. Just
    make an OK decision and be done with it.

- When a restaurant has Tator tots, order it.

## Learning
- Try to formulate pictures of mathematical proofs.

## Research
- Given a problem, start by thinking what a naive enumeration-based approach
    would look like. Go from there.
