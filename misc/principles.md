# Principles
A description of what these are can be found
[here]({% post_url 2019-5-6-Principles%}).

- When a decision is not important, do not waste too much time thinking. Just
    make an OK decision and be done with it.

- Order the recommended item / first thing on the menu at a new restaurant.

- Try to formulate pictures of mathematical proofs.

- Given a problem, start by thinking what a naive enumeration-based approach
    would look like. Go from there.

- Start research projects by clearly defining the motivation.
