excerpt: "About Me..."

I am a first-year master's student in aerospace engineering at Stanford. Before coming to Stanford, I studied computer science at Swarthmore College, where I worked with Professor Bryce Wiedenbeck on multi-agent systems.

You can find my past projects [here](/projects); what I am up to [here](/agenda/). I blog very occasionally [here](/blog).
