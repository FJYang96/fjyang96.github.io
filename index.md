Hello and Welcome!

I am a first-year Ph.D student in the GRASP lab @ UPenn, advised
by Prof. Nik Matni. My research interests are in control theory and machine
learning.

I received my master's in Aero/Astro from Stanford, under the generous support
of a Stanford Graduate Engineering Fellowship. Before that, I did my undergrad
in computer science at Swarthmore College, where I worked on algorithmic game
theory. During undergrad, I also spent a summer at the University of Tokyo
building agent-based models of the labor market.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar, hitting tennis balls, and learning
languages.
