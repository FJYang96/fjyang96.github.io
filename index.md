I am a first-year MSc. student in the [Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics](https://aa.stanford.edu/) at
[Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I am generously supported by the
Stanford Graduate Engineering Fellowship. I am broadly interested in
multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning.

Before coming to Stanford, I graduated with a B.A. in computer science from
[Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu), where I was supported by my
parents' hard-earned savings. At Swarthmore, I had the privilege to work with
[Dr. Bryce Wiedenbeck](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~bryce/) on compact
representation of large games.  I also spent a summer at [the University of
Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) as a research intern, where I had the
privilege to work with [Dr.  Yu
Chen](http://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pros-e/person/yu_chen/yu_chen.htm) on
simulation of economic systems.

A note on my name. My name is 杨逢君. My first name is pronounced as
*FUN-JUNE*. (As a dumb mnemonic, it is the opposite of a *BORING-DECEMBER*.) In
case you are wondering, the meaning of my name in Chinese has nothing to do
with fun, or June.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, learning languages, writing, swimming,
playing tennis, Tator Tots, and Cocoa Puffs.

You can find what I am up to [here](/projects). I blog occasionally
[here](/blog). If you are interested in collaboration, or if you want to make
some suggestions on how I can improve this website, please feel free to reach
me at fyang3[attt]stanford[dottt]edu.
