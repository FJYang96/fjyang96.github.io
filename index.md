## Welcome!

I am a first-year MSc. student in the [Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics](https://aa.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford
University](https://www.stanford.edu/). Before coming to Stanford, I graduated
from [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu) with a B.A. in computer
science. 

I am interested in multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning. In the past,
I have worked on compact representation of large games with [Dr. Bryce
Wiedenbeck](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~bryce/) at Swarthmore, and on
economic simulation with [Dr. Yu
Chen](http://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pros-e/person/yu_chen/yu_chen.htm) at [the
University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

You can find what I am up to [here](/projects). I blog occasionally
[here](/blog).
