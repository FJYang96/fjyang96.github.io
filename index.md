Hi there!

My name is Fengjun Yang (杨逢君, pronounced as *FUN-JUNE YOUNG*). I am a
second-year master's student in Aero/Astro at Stanford University. My research
interests lie in multi-agent systems and control theory. I am currently
supported by a Stanford Graduate Engineering Fellowship.


I did my undergrad in computer science at Swarthmore College, working with
Prof. [Bryce Wiedenbeck](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~bryce/). I also spent a
summer at The University of Tokyo as a research intern, working with [Prof. Yu
Chen](http://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pros-e/person/yu_chen/yu_chen.htm). 

Outside of work, I enjoy learning languages (currently French; in the past
Japanese and German), playing the guitar, and hitting tennis balls.

You can reach me at fyang3[attt]stanford[dottt]edu.
