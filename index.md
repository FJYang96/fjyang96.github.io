Hello and Welcome!

I am a first-year Ph.D student in GRASP lab @ UPenn, advised
by Prof. Nik Matni. I am interested in control theory, specifically
distributed, learning-based control.

I received my master's in Aero/Astro from Stanford, under the generous support
of a Stanford Graduate Engineering Fellowship. Before that, I did my undergrad
in computer science at Swarthmore College, where I worked on algorithmic game
theory. During undergrad, I also spent a summer at the University of Tokyo,
working on simulating economic systems.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar, hitting tennis balls, and learning
languages.
