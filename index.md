## About me
<hr class="index-section-underscore">
<p class="index-text">
I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania, working on data-driven
methods in distributed control. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof.
<a href="https://nikolaimatni.github.io/">Nik Matni</a>. Before coming to Penn,
I studied aero/astro at Stanford (M.Sc.) and computer science at Swarthmore
College (B.A.).

## Research Interest
<hr class="index-section-underscore">
<p class="index-text">
My research interest lies in the intersection of control theory, machine
learning, and multiagent systems. Currently, I am interested in understanding
the sample complexity of learning distributed controllers.

## Misc
<hr class="index-section-underscore">
<p class="index-text">
Outside of work, I enjoy reading, playing the guitar, hitting tennis balls, and learning
languages.
