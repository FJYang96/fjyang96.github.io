## About me
<hr class="index-section-underscore">
<p class="index-text">
I am a Ph.D. student in the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. I am
fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://nikolaimatni.github.io/">Nik
Matni</a>.  Before coming to Penn, I studied aero/astro at Stanford (M.Sc.) and
computer science at Swarthmore (B.A.).

## Research Interest
<hr class="index-section-underscore">
<p class="index-text">
My research interest lies at the intersection of control theory, machine
learning, and multiagent systems. Currently, I am interested in understanding
the sample complexity of learning distributed controllers.
</p>


## Misc
<hr class="index-section-underscore">
<p class="index-text">
Outside of work, I enjoy <a href="./readings.html">reading</a>, playing the guitar, hitting tennis balls, and learning
languages.
