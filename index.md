I am a second-year master's student in the [Aero/Astro
Department](https://aa.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/),
where I am generously supported by the Stanford Graduate Engineering
Fellowship. I am broadly interested in the field of multi-agent systems.

Before coming to Stanford, I graduated with a B.A. in computer science from
[Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu), where I was supported by my
parents' hard-earned savings. At Swarthmore, I had the privilege to work with
[Prof. Bryce Wiedenbeck](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~bryce/) on compact
representation of large games.  I also spent a summer at [the University of
Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) as a research intern, where I worked with
[Prof. Yu Chen](http://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pros-e/person/yu_chen/yu_chen.htm)
on agent-based simulation of complex adaptive systems.

A note on my name: My name in Chinese is 杨逢君. My first name is pronounced as
*FUN-JUNE*. (As a dumb mnemonic, it is the opposite of a *BORING-DECEMBER*.) In
case you are wondering, the meaning of my name in Chinese has nothing to do
with fun, or June.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, learning languages, writing, swimming,
and playing tennis.
