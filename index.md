## About
<hr class="index-section-underscore">
<p class="index-text">
I am a Ph.D. student in the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. I am
fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://nikolaimatni.github.io/">Nik
Matni</a>.  My research interest lies at the intersection of control theory,
machine learning, and multiagent systems. Before coming to Penn, I studied
aero/astro at Stanford and computer science at Swarthmore.

<p class="index-text">
Outside of work, I enjoy reading, playing the guitar, hitting tennis balls, and
learning languages.
