Hi there!

My name is Fengjun Yang. I am a master's student in
[Aero/Astro](https://aa.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford
University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I am generously supported by a
Graduate Engineering Fellowship. My academic interests mostly lie in the field
of multi-agent systems. 

Before coming to Stanford, I graduated with a B.A. in computer science from
[Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu). At Swarthmore, I worked with
[Prof. Bryce Wiedenbeck](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~bryce/) on compact
representation of large symmetric games.  I also spent a summer at [the
University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) as a research intern, where
I worked with [Prof. Yu
Chen](http://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pros-e/person/yu_chen/yu_chen.htm) on
agent-based simulation of complex adaptive systems.

Outside of work, I enjoy learning languages (currently French; in the past
Japanese and German), playing the guitar, and hitting tennis balls.

## A Note on my Name
My name in Chinese is 杨逢君. My first name is pronounced as
*FUN-JUNE*. (As a useless mnemonic, it is the opposite of a *BORING-DECEMBER*.)
In case you are wondering, the meaning of my name in Chinese has nothing to do
with fun, or June.

## Contact
You can reach me at fyang3[attt]stanford[dottt]edu.
