## Welcome!

<img style="float: right;padding-left:30px" src="/images/bio-photo-crop.jpg">

I am a first-year MSc. student in the [Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics](https://aa.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford
University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I am broadly interested in multi-agent
systems and reinforcement learning.

Before coming to Stanford, I graduated
from [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu) with a B.A. in computer
science. At Swarthmore, I had the privilege to work with [Dr. Bryce
Wiedenbeck](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~bryce/) on compact representation of
large games.
I also spent a summer at [the University of
Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) as a research intern, where I had the
privilege to work with [Dr.  Yu
Chen](http://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pros-e/person/yu_chen/yu_chen.htm) on economic
simulation.

You can find what I am up to [here](/projects). I blog occasionally
[here](/blog).

If you are interested in collaboration, or if you want to let me know how I can
improve this website, please feel free to reach me at
fyang3[attt]stanford[dottt]edu.
