I am a first-year MSc. student in the [Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics](https://aa.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford
University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I am broadly interested in multi-agent
systems and reinforcement learning.

Before coming to Stanford, I graduated
from [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu) with a B.A. in computer
science. At Swarthmore, I had the privilege to work with [Dr. Bryce
Wiedenbeck](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~bryce/) on compact representation of
large games.
I also spent a summer at [the University of
Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) as a research intern, where I had the
privilege to work with [Dr.  Yu
Chen](http://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pros-e/person/yu_chen/yu_chen.htm) on economic
simulation.

A note on my name. My first name is Fengjun (pronounced as *FUN-JUNE*). You can
also call me FJ.

You can find what I am up to [here](/projects). I blog occasionally
[here](/blog). If you are interested in collaboration, or if you want to make
some suggestions on how I can improve this website, please feel free to reach
me at fyang3[attt]stanford[dottt]edu.
