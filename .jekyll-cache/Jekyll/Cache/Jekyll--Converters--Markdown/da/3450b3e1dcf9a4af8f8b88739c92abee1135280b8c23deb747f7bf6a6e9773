I"ê<p>The plan here is to work on one (more or less) one fun project
every month and produce some kind of deliverables. The academic project is
usually going to be a simple explicative post on a topic of interest (and not
necessarily directly pertinent to research). The fun project, however, can
potentially vary greatly. I currently have some interesting ideas about the fun
projects, and we will see how it goes.</p>
