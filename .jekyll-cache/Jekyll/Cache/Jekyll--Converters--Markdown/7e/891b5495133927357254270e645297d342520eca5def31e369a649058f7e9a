<p>Hello and Welcome!</p>

<p>I am a first-year Ph.D student in GRASP lab @ UPenn, advised
by Prof. Nik Matni. I am interested in control theory, specifically in
distributed control, robust control, and learning-based control.</p>

<p>I received my masterâ€™s in Aero/Astro from Stanford, under the generous support
of a Stanford Graduate Engineering Fellowship. Before that, I did my undergrad
in computer science at Swarthmore College, where I worked on algorithmic game
theory. During undergrad, I have also spent a summer at The University of Tokyo
as a research intern, working on simulating complex economic systems.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar, hitting tennis balls, and learning
languages (currently French; in the past Japanese and German)</p>
