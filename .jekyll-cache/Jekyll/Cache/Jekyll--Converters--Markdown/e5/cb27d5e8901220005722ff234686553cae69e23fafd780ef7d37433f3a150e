I"&<p>I am a happy user of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. If you are not familiar
with Jekyll, it is a website generator that translates textfiles organized in a
specific fashion into deployable websites. I like Jekyll because it offers an
easy-to-use interface that hides all the technical details involved in
conventional website building.  However, for people who are willing to get
their hands dirty and write their own style sheets, Jekyll is also highly
customizable.  In this post, I compile some references that were helpful for me
when I was building this site. I hope you will find them helpful, too.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">The official quickstart guide</a></strong>: Jekyll has a
  very helpful quickstart guide that walks you through all the basics you need to
  know to create a working website.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">Guide on Github Hosting</a></strong>: Now you
  have a website, you probably want to deploy it somewhere on the internet.
  One way to do it is to host the website as a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/">Github
  page</a>, <em>for free</em>!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>File Organization</strong>: If you are not interested in creating a highly
  customized look for your blog, you probably do not have to know all that
  much about how the files are organized. However, if you are interested in
  writing your own style sheets, or tweaking some existing themes, it will be
  tremendously helpful to spend a minute and read
  <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/">this</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Themes</strong>: You can find open-source Jekyll themes
  <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">here</a>. All you have to do is to download or
  clone the repo of your desired theme. Super simple. The theme I use is
  adapted from <a href="https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template">Steven Miller’s NGVB
  theme</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If you are interested in building upon this theme</strong>: Small tweaks like
  changing background or text colors should be easy to do in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">css/main.scss</code>.
  If you want to change some more refined details such as margins of images
  or size of text boxes, you will have to go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_scss/</code> directory and
  directly change the style sheets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Liquid</strong>: As you probably have read in the Jekyll quickstart
  guide, Jekyll uses a combination of YAML front matter and Liquid to enable
  some cross reference to posts. An example: in the front matter of post <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>,
  you can define a property of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">category</code> with value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">life</code>. This
  value can then be referenced in other pages by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{% A.category %}</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{% ...%}</code> symbolizes a Liquid expression. During
  compilation, these Liquid expressions will be replaced with their actual
  values, so they do not appear in the final HTML files. A helpful
  introduction to the usage of Liquid in Jekyll can be found
  <a href="https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-liquid/">here</a>. The official docs for
  Liquid can be found
  <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Markdown cheatsheet</strong>: Jekyll supports multiple markup languages, and you
  can specify the flavor you are using in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>. (I use
  <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/">Kramdown</a>). There are many Markdown
  cheatsheets online, and a really nice one that I use can be found
  <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MathJax</strong>: What if I want to write equations, you ask?. One way to
  do this is through MathJax. The quick start guide for MathJax can be found
  <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted">here</a>. You can
  type equations (almost) the same way you would in LaTex. One thing to note,
  however, is that, the default configuration I had for MathJax uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$
  ... $$</code> to denote inline math, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\\[ ... \\]</code> for new-line display,
  although I think you can customize this if you want.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-to-do-list">My To-Do List</h2>
<p>There are many aspects of my blogging workflow that can be further optimized,
and here are some of them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scripts for easy post management: I find populating the YAML front matter and
  naming the blog post every time to be pretty annoying. This would certainly
  be a problem if you blog a lot, and of course people have tried to write
  scripts to automate the process. One of such attempts can be found
  <a href="http://joshuasoileau.com/articles/2016/06/08/how-to-implement-a-bash-script-to-create-new-posts-in-jekyll.html">here</a>
  Also, if you use Octopress, there are built-in functionalities that help
  with creating posts.</li>
  <li>Vimrc: I use vim as my editor. I feel there are a lot configuration that can
  be done here to make blogging in Jekyll easier, too.</li>
  <li>LaTeX: Is it convenient (or possible at all) to typeset in Latex and then use
  Pandoc to translate into markdown? Haven’t got a chance to try it, but
  heard some good things about Pandoc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, this is it folks. I hope some of the things in this post have been helpful.
Happy blogging!</p>
