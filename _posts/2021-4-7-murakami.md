I recently finished re-reading *Kafka on the Shore* (Haruki Murakami,
2002). This time around, I set a goal to listen to all of the music referenced
in the book, and hence this list.

## Kafka On the Shore
- **Piano Sonata in D major, D 850.** *Franz Schubert.* Oshima played this in
  his car on the way to the cabin.

- **Little Red Corvette.** *Prince.* Kafka listened to this in the cabin.

- **Heigh Ho,** from Disney's Snow White. Johnnie Walker whistled this tune
  while killing the first three cats.

- **Si, mi chiamano Mimi**, from *La boheme. Giacomo Puccini.* Johnnie Walker
  whistled this tune when he was about to kill Mimi in front of Nakata.

- **The Hollow Men**, *T.S. Eliot.* Poem instead of music. Oshima used this
  poem to describe the feminists that came to the library. He also called
  them as lacking "imagination".

- **Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band**, *The Beatles.* Kafka listened to
  this at the library. (This is after he moved into the library.)

- **Blonde on Blonde**, *Bob Dylan.* Kafka listened to this at the library.
  This is after he tried to play *Kafka On the Shore* on the piano.

- **The White Album**, *Beatles.* Same as above.

- **Sitting On The Dock of The Bay**, *Otis Redding.* Same as above.

- **Getz/Gilberto**, *Stan Getz, Joao Gilberto* Same as above.

- **Sexy M.F.**, *Prince.* Kafka listened to this in the gym.

- **Piano Trio in B-flat major, Op. 97 (The Archduke Trio)**, Composed by
  *Beethoven*, played by *the million dollar trio*. Hoshino heard this in a
  cafe.

- **The Cello Concerto No. 1 in C major, Hob. VIIb/1**, Composed by *Joseph
  Haydn*, played by *Pierre Fournier*. Hoshino heard this in the same cafe one
  day after.

- **Kid A**, *Radiohead*. Kafka mentioned that he had been listening to this
  album since he left home. (This is after his move to the cabin following the
  sex with Ms. Saeki.)

- **The Hit 1**, *Prince*. Same as above.

- **My Favorite Things**, *John Coltrane*. Same as above.
