I recently finished re-reading *Kafka on the Shore* (Haruki Murakami,
2002). This time around, I tried to give a listen to all of the music
referenced, and hence this list. It turned out to be much shorter than I
anticipated, but it could also just be because I missed many of them. No more
rambles, here's the list.

## Kafka On the Shore
- **Piano Sonata in D major, D 850.** *Franz Schubert.* Oshima (the librarian)
  played this on the way he drove Kafka to the mountain cabin.

- **Little Red Corvette.** *Prince.* Kafka listened to this when he was in the
  cabin.

- **Heigh Ho,** from *Snow White (Disney).* Johnnie Walker whistled this tune
  when he killing the first three cats in front of Nakata.

- **Si, mi chiamano Mimi**, from *La boheme. Giacomo Puccini.* Johnnie Walker
  whistled this tune when he was about to kill Mimi in front of Nakata.

- **The Hollow Men**, *T.S. Eliot.* Not really music, but it's an interesting
  reference. Oshima referred to this poem to describe the "feminists" that
  came to the library. He also criticized them as lacking "imagination".

- **Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band**, *The Beatles.* Kafka listened to
  this at the library. (This is after he moved into the library.)

- **Blonde on Blonde**, *Bob Dylan.* Kafka listened to this at the library.
  This is after he tried to play *Kafka On the Shore* on the piano.

- **The White Album**, *Beatles.* Same setting as last.

- **Sitting On The Dock of The Bay**, *Otis Redding.* Same setting as last.

- **Getz/Gilberto**, *Stan Getz.* Same setting as last.

- **Sexy M.F.**, *Prince.* Kafka listened to this in the gym.

- **Piano Trio in B-flat major, Op. 97 (The Archduke Trio)**, Composed by
  *Beethoven*, played by *the million dollar trio*. Hoshino heard this in a
  cafe.

- **The Cello Concerto No. 1 in C major, Hob. VIIb/1**, Composed by *Joseph
  Haydn*, played by *Pierre Fournier*. Hoshino heard this in the same cafe one
  day after.

- **Kid A**, *Radiohead*. Kafka mentioned that he has been listening to this
  album since he left home. (This is after his move to the cabin following sex
  with Ms. Saeki.)

- **The Hit 1**, *Prince*. Same as above.

- **My Favorite Things**, *John Coltrane*. Same as above.
