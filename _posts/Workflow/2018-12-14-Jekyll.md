I am a happy user of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you are not familiar
with Jekyll, it is a website generator that translates textfiles organized in a
specific fashion into deployable websites. I like Jekyll because it offers an
easy-to-use interface that hides all the technical details involved in
conventional website building.  However, for people who are willing to get
their hands dirty and write their own style sheets, Jekyll is also highly
customizable.  In this post, I compile some references that were helpful for me
when I was building this site. I hope you will find them helpful, too.

## Getting Started
- **[The official quickstart guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)**: Jekyll has a
    very helpful quickstart guide that walks you through all the basics you need to
    know to create a working website.

- **[Guide on Github Hosting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)**: Now you
    have a website, you probably want to deploy it somewhere on the internet.
    One way to do it is to host the website as a [Github
    page](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/), *for free*!

## Customization
- **File Organization**: If you are not interested in creating a highly
    customized look for your blog, you probably do not have to know all that
    much about how the files are organized. However, if you are interested in
    writing your own style sheets, or tweaking some existing themes, it will be
    tremendously helpful to spend a minute and read
    [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).

- **Themes**: You can find open-source Jekyll themes
    [here](http://jekyllthemes.org/). All you have to do is to download or
    clone the repo of your desired theme. Super simple. The theme I use is
    adapted from [Steven Miller's NGVB
    theme](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template).

- **If you are interested in building upon this theme**: Small tweaks like
    changing background or text colors should be easy to do in `css/main.scss`.
    If you want to change some more refined details such as margins of images
    or size of text boxes, you will have to go to the `_scss/` directory and
    directly change the style sheets.

- **Liquid**: As you probably have read in the Jekyll quickstart
    guide, Jekyll uses a combination of YAML front matter and Liquid to enable
    some cross reference to posts. An example: in the front matter of post `A`,
    you can define a property of `A` called `category` with value `life`. This
    value can then be referenced in other pages by calling `{{ "{% A.category "
    }}%}`, where `{{ "{% ..." }}%}` symbolizes a Liquid expression. During
    compilation, these Liquid expressions will be replaced with their actual
    values, so they do not appear in the final HTML files. A helpful
    introduction to the usage of Liquid in Jekyll can be found
    [here](https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-liquid/). The official docs for
    Liquid can be found
    [here](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/).

## Markdown
- **Markdown cheatsheet**: Jekyll supports multiple markup languages, and you
    can specify the flavor you are using in `_config.yml`. (I use
    [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/)). There are many Markdown
    cheatsheets online, and a really nice one that I use can be found
    [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

- **MathJax**: What if I want to write equations, you ask?. One way to
    do this is through MathJax. The quick start guide for MathJax can be found
    [here](https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted). You can
    type equations (almost) the same way you would in LaTex. One thing to note,
    however, is that, the default configuration I had for MathJax uses `$$
    ... $$` to denote inline math, and `\\[ ... \\]` for new-line display,
    although I think you can customize this if you want.

## My To-Do List
There are many aspects of my blogging workflow that can be further optimized,
and here are some of them.
- Scripts for easy post management: I find populating the YAML front matter and
    naming the blog post every time to be pretty annoying. This would certainly
    be a problem if you blog a lot, and of course people have tried to write
    scripts to automate the process. One of such attempts can be found
    [here](http://joshuasoileau.com/articles/2016/06/08/how-to-implement-a-bash-script-to-create-new-posts-in-jekyll.html)
    Also, if you use Octopress, there are built-in functionalities that help
    with creating posts.
- Vimrc: I use vim as my editor. I feel there are a lot configuration that can
    be done here to make blogging in Jekyll easier, too.
- LaTeX: Is it convenient (or possible at all) to typeset in Latex and then use
    Pandoc to translate into markdown? Haven't got a chance to try it, but
    heard some good things about Pandoc.

## Conclusion
So, this is it folks. I hope some of the things in this post have been helpful.
Happy blogging!
