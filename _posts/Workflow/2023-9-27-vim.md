# [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
- Can now be done with a simple `sudo snap install neovim`. Installing from
  `apt` gives a very outdated version.

# Packer
This time around, we want to adopt a full lua setup, so we switched from vimplug to packer.

Every time we want to install a new package, go to packer.lua, do a `:so`, and
then run `:PackerSync`.

# Telescope
Fuzzy finder for files and grep searches. Note that the grep search
functionality depends on the external package `ripgrep` or `rg`. Make sure to
install that.

# Treesitter
Language parser for mostly better formatting.

# LSP
Need to install language servers for autocompletion and stuff. We have the
pacakge `Mason` for installing the langauge servers, just type `:Mason` to
bring up the interface, search/scroll to find the language server of interest,
and then hit `i` to install.
