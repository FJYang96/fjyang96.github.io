## Introduction

Sophomore year in collge, I took my first proof-based math class on *the
Probabilistic Method* (PM). Like many first-time proof writers, I struggled a
lot. The funny thing, however, is that this was also the most rewarding class I
had ever taken. In this post, I revisit two particularly memorable examples
from the class, and also present a third example that I stumbled upon in a
different setting. All three examples are elementary, but example 2 assumes
some basic familiarity with graph theory and example 3 some basic convex
analysis. In addition to the theorems (and the proofs thereof), I also include
non-technical digressions.  Even if you did not get the proofs on the first
try, feel free to skip past them and sample some of the stories. :)


## Example 1: Cutting Circles
This first example is more of a brain teaser than serious math. It goes like
this.
> Suppose there is a unit square, and within the square are $$m$$ circles. You
> don't know how many circles there are, how large the circles are, or where
> they are, but you *do* know that their circumferences add up to $$10$$.
> [TODO] Show that ...

Let's start by unpacking and visualizing the statement. The theorem says that
for any given configuration of circles that satisfy the abovementioned
conditions, we can find a corresponding cut that goes through at least four
circles. In the picture on the right, we plot four randomly generated legal
configurations, and a corresponding cut for each.

Note that the reverse is not true. For any given cut, we can easily find a
configuration where all the circles shun the cut. Just find a space where we
can fit a circle, and draw many many of them until the circumference condition
is satisfied. Now, hopefully this fact makes this statement seem a little bit
less trivial.

So, how can we prove this? In many cases, a good way to prove something exists
is to construct it (unfortunately, this only works very occasionally outside
the realm of math). In this example, it would mean that we need to give a
sequence of steps that we can follow to find the cut (a.k.a. an algorithm) that
works universally for all configurations of circles. However, we are going to
take a different route, and use the probabilistic method to write a
non-constructive proof.

You might be wondering: where is the probabilistic part in this problem?
Indeed, up to this point, everything is deterministic. We have to artificially
introduce the randomness here to be able to get a probabilistic statement.
Specifically, we now *consider a random horizontal cut of the square* whose
height is sampled uniformly at random in the range $$[0, 1]$$.


In the preface of *The Probabilistic Method (2008)*, Noga Alon and Joel Spencer gave
the following definition.

## Bounding Ramsey Numbers
Consider a graph $$\mathcal{G}=(V, E)$$ with 3 vertices.

We begin with the result that kicked off the field of the probabilistic
methods -- the OG exponential bound on Ramsey numbers.

## Epilogue
I don't know if I am qualified to call this my favorite class in undergrad.  I
took this class my sophomore fall. I struggled really hard in this class, and I
don't remember anything when I started this post.

Joshua encouraged me. I got good score for the last final.

Now, I have come a long way. Had a great class this semester on probability
theory, almost failed it.
