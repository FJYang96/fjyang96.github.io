Recently, I watched a TED talk by Ray Dalio on Youtube about the benefit of
compiling, by which I think he means actually writing down, a set of principles
to guide future decison-making. The idea of principles here is rather general
and can range from morning routines to Starcraft strategies. (He did not say
Starcraft strategies. Just thought I'd clarify.) Basically, it includes
anything that involves decision-making.

I really like this idea.  First, writing forces one to articulate vague ideas.
As a result, it helps one to clarify one's own thoughts.  Secondly, for
recurring situations, it is probably more efficient to adopt a pre-set action
that has been carefully thought through, rather than to repeatedly make
decisons on the fly. This is in a way similar to defining variables and
functions in computer programs.  You want to avoid typing ugly expressions over
and over again. Lastly, this gives one a chance to rehearse the decision-making
offline. This might lead to more confidence when one is actually presented with
the situation.

I have previously had similar ideas like this one in multiple occasions, but
have not yet found a good way put it into execution. I think a blog/personal
website is a good medium for me to write these principles on. I imagine putting
them in a Google Doc probably would not work for me, as I will simply forget
about them after two days. The same goes for notebooks, too. However, as humble
and awesome as I am, I have to admit: I just really like staring at my personal
website. Hence a great medium.

You can find them [here](/misc/principles.md).
